        <h1> The Sacred in Philosophy | Digan Gurung </h1>
      <p>Philosophy, perhaps more so than any other academic discipline barring theology itself, has always made concessions to the sacred. As it is discussed in this essay, the sacred alludes to those in the domain rendered immune to rational critique. Many renowned philosophers have spoken about God in their writings—Spinoza, Kierkegaard and Descartes come to mind. In a discipline that places emphasis on rational critique, it seems rather counterintuitive to allow for values that seemingly stem from irrationality and the reluctance to subject those values under scrutiny (Katsafanas, 2019, pp. 12). In this essay, we will observe what exactly spurred great thinkers into conceiving of the sacred, with particular emphasis on Plato in particular. We will begin with his most distinctive doctrine, the metaphysical theory of Forms. We will thereafter consider his thoughts on the soul, Plato notably being the very first in the history of philosophy to posit the soul not only as eternal, but principle for both life and cognition (Campbell, 2021). These two notions are intertwined and, much pertinent to our discussion, seem to be put forward unquestioned. Rather, they attain this invulnerability due to the nature of the subjects being considered. Thusly, after establishing what influenced the development of these viewpoints, it will be considered the importance of the standing of the sacred in philosophy. It will ultimately be shown that there is room for the sacred in philosophy.</p>
<p>In Plato’s time, the general consensus with regards to the soul seemed to be that it was, like all material things in the universe, transient and temporary. This we can see in <em>Phaedo</em>:</p>
      <p><em>“[70a] the other things you say, but in regard to the soul men are very prone to disbelief. They fear that when the soul leaves the body it no longer exists anywhere, and that on the day when the man dies it is destroyed and perishes...” (Plato, 1966)</em></p>
      <p>The language used by Cebes here, “men are very prone to disbelief” and “They”, shows that the views being purported are of the majority. This was the climate that Plato and Socrates philosophised in and were seeking to change. The question then is, why did Plato veer away from this paradigm of the soul, and what exactly convinced him of the soul’s immortality? The answer has much to do with the Forms, as we can glean continuing on further down in Phaedo from the arguments put forward by Socrates. In Socrates’ second argument for the immortality of the soul [Phaedo, 74c-e] makes reference to the Form of Equality. He states In Socrates’ third argument [Phaedo, 78c- 84b] the world of the senses, or the sensible world, is juxtaposed with the world of the Forms, the intelligible. These two arguments are refuted, however, by Cebes and Simmias and they will not be considered in detail for the sake of brevity. We will
instead look at the last argument from Phaedo, 102a-107b.</p>
      <p>It is as follows:</p>
      <p>1. [102b-103a] Nothing that is, of the intelligible realm, can ever turn into nor coexist
with its direct opposite.</p>
      <p>Socrates gives an example similar to:</p>
      <p>If 2 > 1 and 3 > 2, 2 did not lose its greatness (of magnitude) that it had next to 1. Rather, Socrates states that the greatness either “goes away or loses its existence in the change” (Plato,
1966). The greatness of the 2 does not become the smallness, nor does it share the property of being great whilst also being small.</p>
      <p>2. [103c-105b] Premise 1 is true not only of opposites, but also of the sensibles which correspond to those intelligibles.</p>
      <p>Socrates gives us an example of fire and snow, a pretty good metaphor, but in my own terms: Black holes and aerogels are not strictly opposites but they both correspond to intelligibles that are, lying on either extreme end of the density spectrum. A black hole cannot be of extremely low density without ceasing to be a black hole, and an aerogel cannot be of infinite density without ceasing to be aerogel.</p>
      <p>3. [105c-d] The soul is what causes a body to be alive.</p>
      <p>Soul → Life</p>
      <p>4. [105d-e] As per the previous premises, the soul cannot then partake in the opposite of life, which is death. And just as that that does not admit light is darkness, for it is the absence of light, that that does not admit death is immortal, for it is the absence of death.</p>
      <p>Soul → Life</p>
      <p>¬ Life</p>
      <p>Therefore, ¬ Soul (modus tollens)</p>
      <p>5. Therefore the soul, which does not admit death, is immortal.</p>
      <p>This last argument is different from the previous ones as it does not rely on a strict faith in what is not necessarily substantiated, making it stand out in our analysis of that which we hold sacred. For example, the first argument procures a rather fickle “principle of balance” [Phaedo, 71e], where Socrates refuses to grant that nature be one-sided, together with the as dodgy ontology of opposites being offered. The second argument is wrought with unreliable premises [Phaedo, 74b] of apparently equal entities being actually “equality deficient”, and presuppositions of
the origins of a priori knowledge. The third argument relies entirely on the presupposed existence of the transcendental realm. At least in this last instance, the premises seem to hold weight. They seem to be logically sound and well substantiated as explored earlier. It also so happens that this last argument is the one that eventually sates the two detractors. That is not to say that the argument is without flaws, but rather that we are able to argue properly with the premises being put forth. In the previous instances, we would have to compete with a “principle of balance” that has just been put up for granted, of equal objects being “equality deficient” and of the transcendental realm. As it stands then, from these arguments for the immortality of the soul, it seems that we should not make room for that sacred, that immune to rational critique. For, if we were to allow for these premises (of what I have highlighted as the more unreliable arguments, that is, the first three) to stand uncontested, we would have gotten Socrates (and Plato) to get away with their claim of the soul’s immortality unchallenged. This would set a dangerous precedent then, for all of philosophy moving forward. The endeavour for knowledge and wisdom would be a fickle one, and the entire discipline would be drenched in mockery. The importance of the soul’s immortality is no fickle matter either, it is paramount in dictating how one should live one’s life, in how we should treat each other, so on and so forth. It seems clear then, that we cannot let such claims be bolstered by unsubstantiated and presupposed claims. Having said that, that is not to say the last argument is not without trace of these elements in their premises either. However, we will see when Plato does attempt to rationalise the existence of the Forms properly, we find something most peculiar.</p>
      <p>Plato relied heavily on the Forms for foundation on ethics and justice, and indeed on how to live a good life, which was the entire purpose of his philosophy. Although the first instance of the Forms occurs in Phaedo, as we saw earlier, we are never truly formally introduced to the concept. In many instances, it seems that he takes it for granted. We are able to decipher,
however, how exactly he began to formulate and account for his belief in the Forms, from Phaedo and from the Republic (Plato, 1966), as we will begin to see.</p>
      <p><em>“If understanding and true opinion are distinct, then these “by themselves” things definitely exist - these Forms, the objects not of our sense perception but of our understanding only...” [Timaeus, 51d]</em></p>
      <p>Plato was, in his endeavour for knowledge, wrought with the violent transience of the world, and sought that which could not change—and surely they must exist, for we had the eternal soul. Although it is presented as an implicit premise that knowledge is possible and exists [Republic, 477a], this is, in my opinion, what spurred Plato down this line of epistemic and metaphysical inquiry to ultimately hold faith in those sacred Forms. Plato, armed with the certainty that the soul was, and always is, posited that there was a realm of alike objects; the Intelligible, with properties very much like the soul—divine, immortal, eternal and uncompounded [Phaedo, 78c-80b]. This was metaphysically, due to what we will come to know as the Forms, what allowed for knowledge to be. Knowledge purely and absolutely had to be a true account of what ‘is’ and ‘was’ by its very nature of being. This is vital in Plato’s
argument for the Forms. The argument and conception of Knowledge goes as follows:</p>
      <p>1. Knowledge exists, and is of what is [The Republic, 477a] </p>
      <p>We note that this first premise, that Knowledge is, is posited as unquestionable.</p>
      <p>2. Knowledge is infallible whereas opinion is not [The Republic, 477b]</p>
      <p>In order the identify the metaphysics of Knowledge that allows it to be infallible, Plato looks towards that which is similar to knowing, but is fallible, that of opinion or belief.</p>
      <p>3. Therefore, what is known must be, and what is believed, may not be.</p>
      <p>That which is known and understood must inherently, as a characteristic be whereas that which is believed might not be, also as an inherent distinction. This seems reminiscent of our
sensibles corresponding to intelligibles earlier in our argument for the soul, but is different in that in cognizing the Forms, this is the distinction or separation of what is an Intelligible, being of the transcendental, atemporal and aspatial realm and what is a Sensible, belonging to this material world, perceived by our senses and subject to change, space and time. This then is the succeeding premise.</p>
      <p>4. Therefore, there are things that purely and absolutely are, as a singular — that which we call the Forms and there are things that are of multiple. [Republic, 479]</p>
      <p>If we were to look back at Socrates’ last argument that I highlighted earlier from Phaedo 102b- 103a, of the examples of the 3 men being compared in stature, this notion of objects partaking in both or many [Republic, 479b] can be elucidated. Simmias, being bigger in stature than Socrates and smaller than Phaedo, has with him both greatness and smallness. In contrast, the greatness as it is has not been diminished nor admitted in the smallness, and likewise for the smallness. These are then of the forms. They purely and absolutely are.</p>
      <p>5. That is, Forms are the objects of knowledge; their participants are objects of belief.
He categorises them as according to their distinctions. They now formally belong to the Intelligible, or to the Sensible. Moreover, very importantly, as the corporeal sensible and the objects of belief, they are <em>fallible</em>.</p>
      <p>What has been done here can be said to be sacrilegious, in the context of this paper. Where the forms used to be sacred, divine and immune to rational critique, here they have been subjected to (though not completely sound) logical rigour. In that profane manner, he has set us down the path of skepticism and solipsism, the same bind that Descartes will later find himself in. All that is profane must be subject to doubt, for nothing in this realm can be infallible. Plato has placed all priority on the immanent and the transcendent and none on the corporeal. As such, for Plato, propositional knowledge cannot persist without an appeal to the Forms. This poses,
in particular, an immense issue for the natural sciences. For example, if Plato were to observe Styrofoam being dissolved in acetone, he might attribute this change in the Styrofoam to be the work of perhaps the Form of Dissolvability, and seek what would affect it. He would place no possibility on there being a relationship between the corporeal, compounded objects of the Styroam and the acetone, which we know to be of non-polarity. He needs to, very ironically, make concessions to the sacred. He needs to take for granted that, as Aristotle will later note, the things which really are, are also mutable.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, philosophy must remain rationally grounded. That is, if we were to make an argument, it must be or attempt to be logically sound. At the same time, there is no doubt that we have to make room for the sacred, a concession to the irrational. We see aspects of this in many other branches of Philosophy, such as in Hume’s problem of induction, and in refuting van Fraasen’s insistence on a “transcendental truth”. The fact of the matter is, reason will only take us so far, and sometimes we have to take things for granted. These things we call the sacred. Inviolable and unquestionable, not because we do not want to, but because we cannot. We require them, and we need them.</p>
